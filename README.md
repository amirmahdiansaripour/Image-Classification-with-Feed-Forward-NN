# Image-Classification-with-Feed-Forward-NN
Classifying images of hand-written numbers in Persian and A-Z alphabets in Englsih.

In the first phase, a Feed-Forward Neural Network is developed from scratch, i.e., concepts of activation function, cross-entropy loss function, stochastic gradient descent, soft-max are developed with basic libraries. The network is trained on hand-written numbers in Persian language. In addition, analyzing different values for learning rate, batch size, and different activation functions on model accuracy are visualized. 


In the second phase, prepared methods in the Tensorflow.Keras library are used to build the NN. This time, the network is trained on a dataset containing hand-written A-Z alphabets. The effect of momentum and Adam optimizer, number of epochs, and L2 regularization term on model accuracy are discussed.
